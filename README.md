# COVID-19 Literature Review (Webtool)

An in-progress web tool to visualize our group's database of systematically reviewed current literature on COVID-19.
This tool is geared towards front-line practising physicians.

This database is being constantly updated with references that have been screened from the vast amounts of research emerging on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. We aim for our database to be as updated and as concise as possible.

## Current Features:
- filterable by title, author, journal, specialty, type of study
- summary of reference is populated with abstract etc
- links to PubMed page

## Team
