## Search Methods
We searched for relevant articles on PubMed with the following search strategy:

```
((((("COVID-19" [Supplementary Concept]) OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" [Supplementary Concept]) OR COVID-19[Title/Abstract]) OR coronavirus 19[Title/Abstract]) OR SARS-COV-2[Title/Abstract] OR wuhan coronavirus AND 2019/12:2030[pdat]) OR 2019-nCoV OR 2019nCoV OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2)
```

Our search is ongoing as new literature emerges. Our repository of unfiltered articles has been updated on the following dates:

- March 28, 2020
- April 8, 2020

## Inclusion Criteria
No strict inclusion criteria were established; the purpose of this literature review is to provide high-yield pertinent research to the front-line clinician across a breadth of areas, specifically oriented towards the Ontario/Canada/North American context of COVID-19.

The overarching driving question is, "What information is most valuable to someone involved in the care of COVID-19 patients?"

In general, the following types of references were usually included unless reasons for exclusion existed:

- Evidence-based documents or guidelines for intervention or treatment
- Clinical trials
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Case studies/reports with unique or significant findings
- Ontario- or Canada-specific analysis
- High-quality narrative reviews
- High-quality expert opinion or consensus


## Exclusion Criteria
Few strict exclusion criteria were applied. As above, our assessment of references was more qualitative than quantitative.

**Absolute exclusion criteria:** 

 - Full text not in the English language  
 - Full text not available via open-access source or institutional login

**Moderate exclusion criteria:**  

 - Poorly referenced or highly subjective with limited contributions to clinical practice
 - Case reports/studies with no unique findings
 - News articles
 - Explanation of journal responses to COVID-19
 - Relevant only to overseas/international settings

## Screening Methods
References were independently screened via title/abstract review by two or more reviewers each.
Disagreements were resolved by group consensus or a third reviewer when necessary.

## Categorization
Reference type, specialties of interest, and relevance to front-line clinicians were assessed and assigned.

## Notes
This tool is a work in progress. It was also developed by a non-professional. It relies on online data from PubMed parsed from official tools, with custom code or public libraries. As such, there may be occasional errors. Please do not rely on any specific data found on this online tool without appropriate confirmation from the source. Errors may include:

- publication date (often incomplete or in varied formats on PubMed)
- relevant specialties (determined by title/abstract review, may not fully capture all applications)
