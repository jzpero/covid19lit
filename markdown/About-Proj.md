## What is this?
Recent literature on COVID-19 is highly variable in scope, quality, and applicability to the front-line physician. In a time where information and time are valuable resources, there must be a resource that provides curated primary and secondary literature so that clinical decisions can be made with more confidence.

This project aims to provide a way to explore higher-quality current literature on COVID-19 that has been curated via a systematic review approach.
