## What is this?
Recent literature on COVID-19 is highly variable in scope, quality, and applicability to the front-line physician. In a time where information and time are valuable resources, there must be a resource that provides curated primary and secondary literature so that clinical decisions can be made with more confidence. This project provides a way to browse current and relevant literature on COVID-19 that has been curated via a systematic review approach.
