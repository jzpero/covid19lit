## What is this?
Recent literature on COVID-19 is highly variable in scope, quality, and applicability to the front-line physician. In a time where information and time are valuable resources, there must be a resource that provides dependable primary and secondary literature so that clinical decisions can be made with more confidence.

This project aims to provide a way to explore **higher-quality peer-reviewed current literature on COVID-19** that has been curated via a systematic review approach. We hope that our work supports **evidence-based clinical decision making** in these uncertain times.

This is a *work in progress*. Expect more improvements and features over the coming days to weeks.

## The Team
